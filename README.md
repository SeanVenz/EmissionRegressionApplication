# Team Tative's Linear Regression on Carbon Dioxide Emissions and Mean Annual Temperature

This repository is for a Simple Linear Regression application. This Analysis model is to forecast the Mean Annual Temperature of the Philippines given the country's Carbon Dioxide emissions in kilotons (kT).

# Regression Dataset
The team gathered recorded data for the past 20 years from The Data World Bank.
The dataset's relationship was validated beforehand using Excel's Data Analysis Regression and was found to have 0.0006 p-value, passing the 0.05 threshold thus the data inputs are statistically significant.

# Regression Application 
After inputting the dataset, the model was then trained using the regression equations:

`A` is for Y-intercept, the point where the graph intersects the y-axis

`B` is for the Slope or the change in y for every unit change in x

`X` is for the Independent variable or the variable the user will input in the Regression application

With these equations and dataset, the Application will then predict the Mean Annual Temperature (Y value) with the inputted Carbon Dioxide emission in kiloton (X value)
